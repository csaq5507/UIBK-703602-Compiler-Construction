## Structure

For this course you will be working together in teams to fulfil assignments.
These assignments will build on-top of each other as the ultimate goal is to build a compiler for a simple, imperative language.

[`bonus_tasks.md`](bonus_tasks.md) contains a list of optional bonus tasks.

You are allowed to use solutions from other teams *after* the corresponding deadline has been reached.
That said, you really should stick to the code-base you are building together with your team rather than just taking the best looking solution.
Sample solutions may be provided *only* on very special occasions.

You will be able to work on the assignments during the lab.
I'll be present for questions all the time, yet a big part of this course is to acquire the necessary knowledge yourself.

Please note that major modifications may be made to assignments until 3 weeks before the deadline.
Minor changes may be made until 1 week before the deadline.
So please double check for modifications before submitting -- Git provides you the diff anyway.

## Grading

Each submission (regarding an assignment) receives a grade.
Your final grade is simply the average of all submission grades.
Yet, every submission must be graded positively in order to pass this course.

During the lab I'll go from team to team and ask simple questions.
Your performance in these question and answer sessions can impact your final grade -- positively as well as negatively.

Be sure to follow the [guidelines](guidelines.md).
Deviating from them (without proper reason) will negatively impact your grade.

### Absence

You must not be absent more than three times to pass this course.
You do not have to inform me about your absence.
